# Serenity Bridge
This is a plugin for the [Serenity JS](https://github.com/SerenityJS/serenity/) server software for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.
The plugin establishes a connection between a Minecraft and Discord server.

## Getting Started
1) Grab the [latest release](https://github.com/palmmc/serenity-bridge/releases/tag/Beta), and put the `.zip` file that you download into your `/plugins/` folder.
2) Extract the `.zip` file into the repository so it becomes a folder, and delete the old `.zip` version once it is complete.
3) Go into the new folder, then into the `/src/` folder, and edit `config.scfg`.
4) Add your token & channel ID (if you don't know how to this step, there is a tutorial link in the file).
5) Customize anything else that you want in the config, then save it, and you're done! Start up your server to begin bridging!

## Feedback
I hope you find good use out of this plugin!
If you have any suggestions, feedback, or bugs, please report them directly to me by joining the [SerenityJS Discord](https://discord.gg/6xBTEZcHHr) and messaging me (**palm1**), or alternatively, create an issue on this github repository.

Happy bridging!
